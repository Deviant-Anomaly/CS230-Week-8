# CS230-Week-8
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?


- Our client, The Gaming Room wanted their current Android only game, Draw It or Lose It, to be available as a web based version of their app. They outlined some basic requirements of making sure there were multiple teams with mulitple players where each team and player had to have a unique name. There was also a major requirement of only one instance of the game being allowed to exist in memory at any time.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?


- I feel I did well with identifying solutions based on the research done on various platforms. Such as my comparisons of different Operating Systems and my explanation of my UML diagram.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?


- Sometimes I struggle to figure out where to start when working on my code; having a Software design document was extremely helpful for outlining my major starting points. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


- I believe I could have done more in identifying design constraints looking back. After doing more research, especially on the cloud and choosing it as my major recommendation for storage and memory management, I should have identified constraints related explicitly to the use of the cloud network.
  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


- The client wanting only one instance of a game at any given time was a major requirement that was satisfied using the Singleton pattern, as well as using annotations to define configurations. The user is the main client of your program, so their satisfaction means the most when it comes to the success of your work.
  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?


- I normally outline the main components of my program and try to work on the main function of a program first, that way I can see how everything else works with main once implemented. I do think after this class though I will be creating more UML diagrams to help me visualize my programs better.
